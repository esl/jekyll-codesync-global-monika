                                The BEAM community is one of the most friendly
                                and helpful tech communities out there but, much
                                as the rest of the tech world, it&#39;s nowhere
                                near as diverse as its members would wish it to
                                be. Code Sync is addressing this problem and
                                commits to building a technology scene where
                                everybody, regardless of their gender, race,
                                sexual orientation, religion, nationality, age,
                                socioeconomic background etc. feels welcome and
                                comfortable.

                                The goal of scheme is to increase diversity of
                                attendees and offer support to those in the tech
                                community who would not otherwise be able to
                                attend the conference.
